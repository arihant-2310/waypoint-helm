Thank you for installing HashiCorp Waypoint!

Waypoint will take a few minutes to bootstrap. Once it is bootstrapped, you
can log in to the local CLI by running the following command. If this command
fails, please wait a few more minutes and try again.

  $ waypoint login -from-kubernetes

Once logged in, you can use the "waypoint ui" command to open the web interface.
Alternately, you can visit the address of the load balancer service configured.

If anything fails to configure properly you can uninstall this release:

  $ helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }}
