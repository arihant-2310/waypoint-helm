# Waypoint Helm Chart

**Work-In-Progress.**

This is a Waypoint Helm chart that brings up Waypoint nightly on Kubernetes.
See the `values.yaml` for values you can set for configuration. Because
this is WIP we don't publish this yet.

## Usage

#### Install the Helm Chart

```sh
$ helm install waypoint ./
...
```

#### Wait for Waypoint to Initialize

It takes anywhere from 15 seconds to a few minutes for Waypoint to
finish bootstrapping. I recommend just waiting for the load balancer
to be ready with an IP:

```sh
# Not ready yet
$ kubectl get service waypoint-ui
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                        AGE
waypoint-ui       LoadBalancer   10.245.138.80   <pending>     443:30836/TCP,9701:31734/TCP   4m42s

# Ready! (See External IP)
$ kubectl get service waypoint-ui
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                        AGE
waypoint-ui   LoadBalancer   10.245.138.80   143.244.211.64   443:30836/TCP,9701:31734/TCP   9m15s
```

Copy the external IP. In this example it is `143.244.211.64`.

#### Log In

The Helm chart puts the initial token in the `waypoint-server-token`
Kubernetes Secret. Once you read this token, you can delete or rotate it
if you want.

Get the token:

```sh
$ kubectl get secret waypoint-server-token -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode
3K4wQUdH1dfFHsFkYxmzzMHimJj6UE9tH4PhBQcLK9WACNmxHwmEJhqrvVGwVxaT2KUNtFUCAr7Wd3ci5NmFm6sRuKutzsn7CGs71ip2bnEywfEyxt7eaBvsn3kbCMjKzWPrEonR4Q7jgt6k‚èé
```

Log in:

```sh
$ waypoint login -token=<token> <external ip>:9701
Authentication complete!
```

**Important:** Note the port `9701` we add to the IP. This is so that we
target the gRPC port.
